abstract = {Formal Verification: An Essential Toolkit for Modern VLSI Design presents practical
approaches for design and validation, with hands-on advice to help working engineers
integrate these techniques into their work. Formal Verification (FV) enables a designer
to directly analyze and mathematically explore the quality or other aspects of a Register
Transfer Level (RTL) design without using simulations. This can reduce time spent
validating designs and more quickly reach a final design for manufacturing. Building
on a basic knowledge of SystemVerilog, this book demystifies FV and presents the practical
applications that are bringing it into mainstream design and validation processes
at Intel and other companies. After reading this book, readers will be prepared to
introduce FV in their organization and effectively deploy FV techniques to increase
design and validation productivity. Learn formal verification algorithms to gain full
coverage without exhaustive simulation Understand formal verification tools and how
they differ from simulation tools Create instant test benches to gain insight into
how models work and find initial bugs Learn from Intel insiders sharing their hard-won
knowledge and solutions to complex design problems Table of Contents Formal Verification:
From Dreams to Reality Basic Formal Verification Algorithms Introduction to SystemVerilog
Assertions Formal Property Verification Effective FPV For Design Exercise Effective
FPV for Verification FPV Apps for Specific SOC Problems Formal Equivalence Verification
Formal Verification's Greatest Bloopers: The Danger of False Positives Dealing with
